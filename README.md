# A code  for Pointwise Entropy Distributions for a Group Characteristic in High-dimensional and Sparse Microbiome Compositions


Our paper mainly propoes the concept of pointwise-entropy, 
which provides a flexible framework for community-level hypothesis testing without relying on strict distributional assumptions. 
By constructing realistic probability models for OTU distributions, it enables the detection of significant microbiome group differences using statistical and computational tecniques.

## How to use

---

Here, we show the permutaion for community-level hypothesis testing for synthetic dataset as referenced in the paper. 
run `simulation.py` to try various simulation, you can change various conditions such as overdispersion parameter $\theta$. 


## Tutorial

---

from Example folder, you can see examples of synthetic data generation and  meta analysis of them, original version of permutation with phylum-level microbiome. Instructions are detailed in Jupyter notebook.
